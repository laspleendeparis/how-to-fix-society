# how-to-fix-society
This repository outlines ways of improving society

## Bottom Up Approach
(start with the individual - family/community - society)
- look outside yourself to your communities (inspired by 99% perspiration talk)
  1) implement lending libraries
  2) implement green spaces
  3) facilitate discussions on certain topics
  4) create clubs to engage with people
  5) start a tour group to highlight positives of your town/city
  6) collaborate with local businesses to create unique experiences
  7) design walkable, sustainable cities; design around the people, not the transportation
  8) utilize established platforms (social media, podcasts, etc) to get feedback from the community (inspired by Adam Conover's Trans Comedians podcast episode)
- donate money, food, time, etc to those who need those resources
- set aside our differences
- work together to solve societies' problems
- produce open source software and democratize technology (it's a collective effort, we're all on the same team), also start a collaborative effort (such as what people in /r/programmingbuddies are doing)
- work towards a post-scarcity society (let's tackle the biggest problems in society together)

### Accountability and Responsibility
Some topics inspired by Andrew Tate
- Address issues of mental health and access to guns
- Parents need to parent and have a sense of honor and accountability
- No one feels attached to their environment due to generic buildings and uninspired city design
- Maintain a fit and healthy body
- People need to make an effort to change
- Hold people accountable for their actions
- Raise the next generation with good moral and ethical values

### Start your own business
- Come up with a good/product/service that your local community needs.
- Implement profit sharing

### Support local businesses
- Buy from and invest in local businesses.

## Top down approach
(from govt, corporations, and financial institutions to individuals)
Some topics inspired by Heresy Financial
- Reallocating the federal government budget to needs-based instead of age-based
- Bring the military home; if more countries are peaceful, there would be less need for military force
- Replace and/or augment the Federal Reserve (central bank) with decentralized banks
- Establish digital resources (note: not currency) for trade and commerce (inspired by Planet Nine)
  (Although in a post-scarcity society, there would be no need for a currency)
- Change the way wealth is distributed
- Revise legislation and modify tax structures on corporations and the very wealthy (instead of increasing shareholder value, focus on society best practices)

### Universal basic income (UBI)
- Inspired by Andrew Yang

### Establish cooperative businesses
- Business or organization owned by and operated for the benefit of its members
  
### Provide public utilities
- Local provider of public infrastructure including water, gas, electricity, and other natural resources
  
### The nuclear route
- scrap the current system and rebuild from the ground up

### Support Marginalized Communities

Even in the (semi-)developed world, institutionalized inequality is written in the law. One such example is discrimination based on sexual orientation. Currently, some but not all developed countries recognize same-sex couples on some level, and recently there has been growth in this area. But we still have a long way to go.

| Jurisdiction | Current Status | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| Navajo Nation | Civil unions are unrecognized. Marriage is banned. | Turn that bill into law.  In 2023, a bill was passed to repeal the marriage ban and has passed initial proceedings. |
| Serbia | Marriage is defined as being between a man and a woman.| Recognize civil unions. |
| Cyprus | Civil unions are recognized. | Recognize marriage. |
| Israel | Marriage only performed in Tel Aviv. Marriage is recognized if performed in a foreign jurisdiction. | Perform marriage everywhere. |
| Iran | Male: punishable by death. Female: punishable by 100 lashes, or by death on her fourth offense. | Revoke the death penalty. |
| United Arab Emirates   | Minimum 6 months in prison. Prosecuted only on complaint of a husband or male legal guardian. Illegal to campaign. | Reduce minimum prison sentence to 3 months and maximum to 11 years. Legalize campaigning. |
| China | Recognizes legal guardianship. | Recognize civil unions. |
| Singapore | Doesn't recognize marriage or civil unions. | Recognize civil unions. |
| Hong Kong | Couples are afforded limited legal rights. | Recognize civil unions. |
| South Korea | Offers spousal support to couples, such as health insurance. | Recognize civil unions. |

### End Violence

Violence most commonly falls into four categories:

1. Domestic violence
1. Child abuse
1. Police brutality
1. Medical malpractice

#### Domestic Violence

Domestic violence within police families is a deeply concerning issue, hidden. Studies have shown a higher prevalence compared to the general population.
Domestic violence occurs in at least 40% of police officer families, a rate 2-4 times higher than the 10% found in the general population. A police department harboring domestic violence offenders within its ranks can't protect and serve victims in the community. The department exposes itself to civil liability when officers cover up domestic violence committed by colleagues.

Victims of police officer abusers face especially ominous dangers. The abuser possesses a firearm, increasing the risk of severe harm. The abuser knows shelter locations, hindering the victim's ability to seek help safely. The abuser understands how to manipulate the legal system, avoid accountability, and blame the victim. Victims fear reporting the abuse, knowing that responding officers are the abuser's friends, biasing investigations or covering up.

Police departments fail to **adequately address domestic violence committed by their own officers** despite legal mandates. Cases are frequently handled informally without official reports, which can enfeeble efforts to ensure the victim's safety. This contradicts established laws. Nearly half of police departments lacked specific policies for dealing with officer-involved domestic violence. The most common disciplinary action for a substantiated domestic violence allegation was counseling. Termination after a second offense was rare. Studies indicate inconsistent practices regarding firearm seizure for officers accused of domestic violence. Model policies exist, but there's little evidence of widespread implementation.

The failure to **hold violent officers accountable** has far-reaching consequences. Officers are unlikely to be arrested even when found guilty, creating a perception of impunity. Prosecution rates for domestic violence cases involving police officers are lower than for the general population. Sustained allegations of domestic violence don't affect performance evaluations, and violent officers are even promoted.

A 1997 investigation of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) revealed a disturbing pattern of mishandling domestic violence cases. A legal consultant, Bob Mullally, exposed LAPD personnel files documenting numerous violent domestic crimes committed by officers. The LAPD sued Mullally for leaking the information instead of addressing the problem. Mullally was sentenced to 45 days in federal prison for violating a civil protective order, while the officers he exposed faced no prosecution for their crimes. An in-depth investigation by the Office of the Inspector General concluded that the discipline imposed on officers found guilty of domestic violence "was exceedingly light when the facts of each incident were examined."

Laws exist to **prevent domestic abusers from possessing firearms**, but enforcement remains fraught with challenges at best despite federal law. Individuals subject to protective orders are also prohibited from possessing firearms, with a limited "official use" exemption for on-duty police personnel. Officers circumvent the gun ban by pleading to charges other than domestic violence. Courts fail to **notify police departments when protective orders are issued against officers**. The threat of losing their job can motivate officers to further intimidate victims into silence.

Implementing clear policies for handling officer-involved domestic violence requires intensive oversight with independent, impartial investigations of all allegations. **Impose meaningful disciplinary actions and support criminal prosecution for officers found guilty of domestic violence.**

#### Child Abuse

A Washington Post investigation has uncovered a disturbing pattern of child sexual abuse by law enforcement officers. The system fails to **hold offenders accountable**. Nearly 1,800 police officers have been charged with child sexual abuse crimes over the past two decades. Shockingly, nearly 40% of those convicted avoided prison time. The investigation, which analyzed the Henry A. Wallace Police Crime Database, found that ~1 in 10 officers charged with crimes between 2005-2022 were accused of sexually abusing minors. The most common charges included rape (39%), crimes related to child sexual abuse material (20%), and forcible fondling (19%). 83% of charged officers were convicted, but only 61% received prison time. 24% received sentences as light as probation. Even those imprisoned received relatively short sentences, with half sentenced to less than five years. The lenient sentencing is attributed to how judges treat police officers.   Prosecutors have discretion in charging decisions and plea bargains, and judges often show inordinate leniency in sentencing. Police departments also bear responsibility. The investigation revealed instances of departments rehiring officers who had been fired for misconduct, only to be convicted of abusing children later. Police sexual abuse is prevalent.

> This happens to communities all across the country, but it's not on people's radar. And then, police chiefs adhere to the bad apples theory, where they say, "There's nothing to see here, we got rid of this problem when we fired them."

-- Phillip Stinson, Criminal Justice Professor at Bowling Green State University

#### Medical Malpractice

Medical malpractice is a worsening problem in the United States. Patients face increasing risks of injury, even during routine medical care.

Medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death in America. 9.5% of all U.S. deaths can be attributed to medical errors. This amounts to ~251k deaths per year. The number of patient deaths caused by medical malpractice is estimated to be four times higher than reported numbers. As many as 400k patients who are hospitalized every year experience some form of preventable harm during their care. 25-120k patient deaths occur every year due to medical negligence.
32% of all medical malpractice claims are due to misdiagnosis. 25% of all claims are attributed to surgical errors, such as wrong site surgery or leaving an instrument inside of a patient. 2.7% of medical malpractice claims are caused by anesthesia errors. 1.5M people are injured every year due to prescription medication errors. 40-80k patients are injured each year as the result of a diagnostic error. One-third of patients whose physicians made a diagnostic error during their care experienced an injury as a result. 75% of medical malpractice cases involving surgeons are the result of an intraoperative error.

Only 2.9% of all medical malpractice victims end up filing claims against a hospital or medical professional. Only 5% of patients who file a claim will receive a settlement. <1% of patients who **file medical malpractice claims** go to trial to resolve their case. Just 0.1% of patients who go to trial receive a favorable verdict. As many as 70% of medical malpractice settlements are reduced in court before being paid to the plaintiff. Medical providers and facilities avoid as much as 80% of the financial damages that their negligence causes. Unfortunately, it's estimated that 80-90% of medical malpractice lawsuits are dismissed with the plaintiff receiving no settlement. Medical malpractitioners pay >$184B in settlements every year. This equates to ~$552 per capita over the general population. 21% of US citizens report they have been the victim of a medical mistake. Only half of providers take responsibility for a medical error when communicating what happened to the patient. 31% of Americans report seeing someone else experience a medical mistake. 6 in 10 adult victims of malpractice report that their issue was misdiagnosed. 4 in 10 adult malpractice victims report that they weren't treated with respect during their care. Over half of patients who've experienced a medical error report that it happened in an outpatient care setting. 8 in 10 U.S. citizens agree that patient safety is the responsibility of health care providers and facility administration. Patients who experience a medical error report an average of 7 contributing factors per instance of malpractice. 73% of patients who experienced a medical error report that they were left with long-term or permanent effects. 10% of U.S. citizens report experiencing emotional harm when receiving healthcare services. In 2017, only 62% of patients reported being confident that their doctor would be able to accurately diagnose them. Only 68% of patients surveyed felt they were given enough information about their condition. Only 59% of patients surveyed felt that their doctors made a timely diagnosis. 46% of patients report that an error was made during testing. Adverse events are estimated to occur in 5% of outpatient cases and 17% of inpatient hospitalizations. The rate of hospital-acquired infections is estimated to be 1 in every 20 patients. Hospital-acquired infections are estimated to cost between $35.7-45.0B every year. 75% of male physicians are named as a defendant in a malpractice case compared to 42% of female healthcare providers. Underinsured patients are far more likely to report negative experiences in medical settings than patients who have access to healthcare coverage. 25% of women experience errors in their medical care compared to just 17% of men.

Measures should be considered to combat medical malpractice and improve patient safety. **A system in place to document when medical errors occur ensures appropriate review and disciplinary actions.** Hospitals should have clear protocols for addressing medical errors. **Establish guidelines for healthcare professionals' involvement in political activities and lobbying efforts.**
